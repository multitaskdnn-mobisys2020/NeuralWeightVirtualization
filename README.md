# Fast and Scalable In-memory Deep Multitask Learning via Neural Weight Virtualization

## Introduction
This is open-source repository of the paper titled "***Fast and Scalable In-memory Deep Multitask Learning via Neural Weight Virtualization***", which is submitted to MobiSys 2020. It enables fast and scalable in-memory multitask deep learning on memory-constrained embedded systems by (1) packing multiple DNNs into a fixed-sized main memory whose combined memory requirement is larger than the main memory, and (2) enabling fast in-memory execution of the DNNs.
